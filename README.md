1. Create a new repo and upload file into the repo. Pull that file into local directory and make changes in files and upload them into repo.

2. Create a new branch from master and upload some files into the branch and merge them into master branch

3. Clone the repo to local directory and make some changes to one of the file. Commit and push them into GitHub repo. Do git revert to revert the commited changes to previous version.
4. Just create a repo in GitHub itself directly.
